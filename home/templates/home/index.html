    <h1 class="mb-3 h2">Lake Boatandhoes welcomes you!</h1>

    <p>
        Grab a drink, soak yourself and go for a swim in the deepest lake in the world! Let the 'Langers' take care of
        your precious body and keep you from the countless predators soaring the waters.
    </p>
    <p>You'll might find yourself wondering how this sounds lovely, but try and compare this to learning a new language,
        or perhaps how a machine functions. Suddenly a bottomless lake with bloodthirsty predators doesnâ€™t sound so bad,
        right? </p>
